  * **Moses warned them not to go** - This means that Moses told them not to go to fight against the Canaanites because they would be in danger if they did that.
  * **God was not with them** â€“ In other words, God would not be with them to help them. Because of the Israelites' disobedience, God withdrew from them his presence, protection, and power.
  * **but they did not listen to him** - They did not obey Moses. They went to attack the Canaanites anyway.

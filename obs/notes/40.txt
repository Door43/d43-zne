====== 40. Jesus Is Crucified ======


===== Overview: =====


Jesus carried his own cross to his crucifixion. The soldiers nailed him to the cross and gambled for his clothes. The crowd mocked Jesus, and God sent darkness over the whole land. Finally, Jesus asked God the Father to receive his spirit and he died. Two of the Jewish leaders who believed in him placed his body in a new tomb and closed it with a large stone.
